- **Key Observations:**
  - Drain current (IDS) increases with varying gate voltage (VGS) from −2V to 2V.
  - High gate voltages enhance 2DEG current density due to strong polarization effects.
  - Dielectric below the gate reduces current collapse, improving device efficiency.
  - Normal-on behavior in AlGaN HEMT increases leakage current, degrading performance.
