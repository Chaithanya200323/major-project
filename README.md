### Extended Project Abstract   
In recent years, developing highly sensitive and selective biosensors has become crucial for various biomedical applications. HEMT-based biosensors, particularly Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor High Electron Mobility Transistors (MOSHEMTs), are gaining attention for their high sensitivity, quick response, and compatibility with harsh conditions, outperforming silicon-based devices due to GaN's stability and wide bandgap. These biosensors have diverse applications, including biomolecule, pH, DNA, and antigen detection, and utilize chemical reactions to detect biochemical compounds.  

The proposed biosensor leverages the unique properties of dielectric modulation and charge plasma to enhance sensitivity and selectivity in detecting biomolecules. The MOSHEMT structure incorporates dual channels and a dielectric modulation technique, where specific regions of the gate dielectric are etched to create cavities. These cavities are filled with target biomolecules, causing changes in the dielectric constant and, consequently, the electrical characteristics of the device.  

The dual-channel configuration enhances current conduction and sensitivity by increasing the surface area available for biomolecule interaction. The results demonstrate that the dielectric-modulated dual-channel MOSHEMT achieves high sensitivity and selectivity, outperforming conventional AlGaN/GaN-based biosensors.  

The charge plasma technique creates a high-density electron channel without the need for doping, reducing fabrication complexity and improving device reliability. Additionally, the dual-channel configuration provides a larger sensing area and better control over the channel's electrical properties, further improving performance.  

Overall, the proposed MOSHEMT biosensor demonstrates excellent potential for label-free detection of a wide range of biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules. Its high sensitivity, low power consumption, and scalability make it suitable for integration into portable and wearable diagnostic devices. Future work will focus on experimental validation of the simulation results and optimizing the device structure for specific biosensing applications.
